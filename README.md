## Project Overview
Welcome to Tianjin Cycle Meet (TCM) a local cycle initiative aimed to motivate both social and serious cyclists into weekly rides that contribute towards developing a structured cycle routine. TCM is aimed to attract cyclists from all districts across the city and will target users of different abilities. The TCM site was designed to be portal where both new and returning users can find information relating to the details of when and where the next cycle meet would take place. 

The goal for this project was to combine my understanding of html and CSS to create an easy to use site that motivates local cyclists into improving their fitness through group cycle meets.

## UX

### Project Goals
* The project is aimed at providing a convenient and seamless way for cyclists to join an organized training ride in Tianjin, China.

* It is aimed at targetting both social and serious cyclists who need some structure to their weekly training or for those who have fears of riding alone and maybe find it difficult to plan a productive training session.

* The site will also be updated on a monthly basis to offer users different location choices around the city.

* The model of TCM is to provide pre-oragnized routes determined by a regular team of cyclists who will accompany all groups, with every group having a lead rider and a sweeper to ensure that the entire group is supported from start to finish.

### Design Choices
* The site was designed to create motivation within the local cycling community by offering a fresh and sporty site that encourages users to join an organized training session. Design choices were chosen to provide a motivating and easy to use site.


#### Colors
* The color palette for the site was inspired by the INEOS Grenadiers British professional cycling team, although the exact colors were not used, a similar pallette of red, blue and white were used from the initial inspiration. Applying opacity on the red or grey overlays to compliment key information such as areas, meeting times and locations. A more distint variation of red was added to the sign up form to make it more present on the page. Coolors.co was used to generate the palette as seen in the image below.

- red (#b61614)
- blue (#0074d0)
- White (#FAFAFA)

#### Typography
* The website contains two primary font types 'Bebas Neue' for the header and headings which was then paired with the body text of Roboto using Google Fonts. Here is a [link](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) which was used to compare and determine which fonts would compliment each other best for this sort of site. The inclusion of 'sans-serif' was applied as a fall-back font.

#### Images
* The images for the site were chosen to represent a culture of motivation, inspiration and cycling fitness. The Home page hero image is aimed at providing and immediate sense of group support and shared enjoyment. The routes page chainring image was used mainly to give contrast to this page using an overlay effect. The bike cockpit on the signup page was aimed at depicting the feeling that the user is a step closer to their first organized group cycle. The above images were sourced from Pexels [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

#### Animations
* Animations were applied to the home and and signup page images with the intention of catching the users attention once landing on the page. The social icons also had a transform effect applied to it, in order to give some character to the icons with the intention of attracting the user.

#### Icons
* Icons were used to give the site more character and keep within the theme of cycling. The gear icon associated with the header is the central icon and was made consistent across all pages with the header. On the routes page specific icons were chosen to represent the choice of rides that were available to the user. The social icons chosen were used to give familiarity to the various social platforms. Hover effects were applied to all navigation tabs, social icons and the submit button give the user more awareness. 

#### Maps
* Satelite maps were used to show the meeting points and to some degree the terrain for the cycle options. The specific meeting points included text showing the address of the meeting point so that it is easier for first time users to identify where to meet and for returning users to either confirm a meeting point or perhaps find new/updated points.

### Wireframes
Initial designs for the site were created using Balsamiq, the completed project is very closely designed to match the wireframes provided below for mobile, table and desktop. Some adjustments were made to the location of text, buttons and sections when compared to the completed project.

## Website Structure
The website was original designed to be an easy to use platform. The site follows a simple structure and consists of 3 pages. It was initially designed for mobile use with responsiveness being applied to account for both tablet and desktop usage. No compromise was made in terms ofvsharing the same experience across all devices. User interest and comfort was carried through the entire site, the use of animated images to catch the eye and hover effects on pages and buttons to ensure ease of use at any point on the site.

### Lighthouse Audits
- I ran a lighthouse audit through [web.dev audit](https://web.dev/) to check the overall performance of the site. Some adjustments needed to be made to improve the results. The following changes were made:
    - Change in text and overlay and footer colors (Whitesmoke to white) 
    - Alignment of Club Details content to centre (accommodate for wide-screen) and 
    - A reduction in image sizes.

Below is an image of the audit results:
