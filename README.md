## Project Overview
Tianjin Cycle Meet (TCM) has the intention to motivate social cyclists into meeting weekly to help in developing a structured cycle routine. It will attract cyclists from all districts across the city and will target both hobby and serious cyclists to support their training needs. The TCM site will be valuable to cyclists to see the details of when and where they need to meet to join the group rides.

## UX

### Project Goals
* The project is aimed at providing a convenient and seamless way for cyclists to join an organized training ride in Tianjin, China.

* It is aimed at targetting both hobby and serious cyclists who need some structure to their weekly training or for those who have fears of riding alone and maybe find it difficult to plan a productive training session.

* The site will also be updated on a monthly basis to offer users different location choices around the city.

* The model of TCM is to provide pre-oragnized routes determined by a regular team of cyclists who will accompany all groups, with every group having a lead rider and a sweeper to ensure that the entire group is supported from start to finish.

### Design Choices
* The site was designed to create motivation within the local cycling community by offering a fresh and sporty site that encourages users to join an organized training session. Design choices were chosen to provide a motivating and easy to use site.


#### Colors
* The colour palette for the site was inspired by the INEOS Grenadiers British professional cycling team, although the exact colours were not used, a different variation of red, blue and white were used from this inspiration. Using opacity on the red to compliment key information like areas and meeting times and locations.
